# Config files

A collection of config files.

For zellij and alacritty, alongside neovim, make sure that a nerd font is installed.

## nvim

Most recent nvim config is at https://github.com/josmas/dot_config-nvim, based on the lazyvim template.

# Update

I am in the middle of moving all config files to this repo to be used with GNU stow.

For now only nvim is available, which means that the dot_config-nvim repo mentioned above is not being used anymore.

## How to use stow

To use stow simply `cd` into a directory and run something like `stow nvim -t $HOME`.
